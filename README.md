# Model Card for Model ID
model_id = "Milkyway-islander/Movie_Reivews_Llama-3-8B"
<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->



## Model Details
Input Models input text only.

Output Models generate text and code only.

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->
This model is trained and fine tuned on 1500 movie reviews from IMDB movie review dataset. It aims to generate highly human like movie reviews. 
This is the model card of a ðŸ¤— transformers model that has been pushed on the Hub. This model card has been automatically generated.
